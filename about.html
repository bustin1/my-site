			<p> Raised in the Bay Area of California, I was lucky to live with an affectionate family of 4 - my dad, mom, and brother. In my early childhood, my parents would describe me as "energetic". Every month, I went through a pair of shoes because I persistently kicked the ground or rubbed my shoes against the concrete whenever I had the chance. In school, I discovered <span id="dots"> ... </span> <span id="more"> a natural affinity for math. I tried to finish every math worksheet as fast as I could. At home, I completed old math workbooks from my brother because I wanted to get ahead. Whenever I wasn't solving math problems or burning through pairs of shoes, I played countless hours of videogames, such as Mario Kart, Star Wars Battlefront, Pokemon, etc. In hindsight, I didn't realize the impact videogames had on my motivation to learn computer science. I didn't even know what computer science was - I thought videogames involved magic. </span> </p>

			<p> Middle school is where I developed my other affinity: running. All 3 years of middle school I joined the XC and track team. I wasn't really serious about competition, but I do like to win. Anyways, there are many things I did in middle school, like chess and math competitions, and although I wasn't bad, by the end of junior high I began to love computer science.</p>
			<p> By high school, my passion for running and computer science really accelerated. I joined the computer science club and learned how to create 2D graphics in java - this lead me to create games such as Snake, Pacman, and a knock-off version of MarioMaker. I also learned how to code competitively, but I soon realized that coding algorithms wasn't something I liked nor was good at. Whenever I code, I prefer to think about each line rather than spamming lines of code. </p>
			<p> On the dirt, I found something enjoyable about running everyday. Maybe it was the friendships and bonds that I earned or maybe it was the satisfaction after a runner's high, but running carved a facet of my life. Towards the end of high school, I started to win my dual meets and eventually league championships. Just to let you know, I am a long distance runner. </p>
			<p> Knowing what I wanted to do in college, I applied to Carnegie Mellon in Pittsburgh and was fortunately accepted as a CS student and XC/track athlete. All excited and confident in my abilities, the first month of school bulldozed me. I felt drowned in work not by its amount, but by its shear difficulty. On top of school, I really felt the pressure of an NCAA sport. In the beginning I had to wake up 6:00 AM to make it to practice. The runs were longer, faster, and the workouts were much harder. Homesickness also didn't help - I really dug deep to stay mentally in it. I'm not gonna tell you that I discovered an all-in-one solution to cope with the stress, I just mentally pushed through it. By the end of the first semester, I learned two life lessons. The first being learning how to study, reading textbooks, asking for help, etc. The second being gratitude. I became grateful for the education I received from school and my teammates who helped me push through the toughest of workouts. And especially my family, special notice to my parents, who called me every week to make sure that I was still healthy(They also paid for my tutition...).</p>
			<p> So that is my story, not exhaustive but a run down of the most important stuff that I thought off the top of my head in order for you to have a sneak peak into my life.</p>
